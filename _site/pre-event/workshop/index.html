<br /><strong>Learning to build a efficient web application quickly is increasingly important. This workshop (and more) will equip you with the skills and tools to build your own web application. Here are some of the tools you will learn!</strong><br /><br />
  
<strong>Timing for 17 May: 1400-1600</strong><br /><br />

Flask is used as a web-framework. This will form the basis for the web-application.<br /><br />Participants will also learn about the basics of HTML (Markup Language for the Web) and CSS (Casacading Style Sheets for nice designs), along with other frameworks to improve their website's user interface and experience.<br /><br />
SQL forms an important part in our applications, by helping to store a variety of user data!<br />
Participants will explore the concepts of:

<h2 id="past-python-workshops">Past Python Workshops</h2>

<h3 id="ai-cum-ctf-cum-google-code-in">AI cum CTF cum Google-Code In</h3>

<p>We had our very first BuildingBloCS workshop on 14 January 2020. It taught ‚ÄòO‚Äô-Level computing students about Artificial Intelligence, Capture The Flag, and promoted Google Code-In 2019. The participants had a lot of fun with the workshop and potentially made new friends with each other! <br /><br />

<h3 id="circuit-programming-with-adafruit-circuit-playground-express"><a href="https://youtu.be/DsDeCd6VNj0">Circuit Programming with Adafruit Circuit Playground Express</a></h3>

<p>Over the March school holidays, a group of BuildingBloCS students/alumni from DHS and JPJC came together online to produce a series of Python workshops, and we would like to share them with you and the community. You may view the videos that have been uploaded on Youtube.<br /><br />
<a class="btn" href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/HWpBV3mRVwjM55ez5">Photos</a></p>

<p>The Python workshops covers a large proportion of many of the applications in H2 Computing, as well as many of its real-world applications. You will be led through a series of lecture slides and have a chance to perform some hands-on activities. We hope that these will entice you further to pursue computing in your future. :)</p>

<p>Some of these workshops have also been conducted at <a href="https://summit.fossasia.org/">FOSSASIA‚Äôs Summit</a> at Paya Lebar‚Äôs Lifelong Learning Institute.</p>

<h3 id="web-development-with-flask"><a href="https://youtu.be/074b8o15Vnc">Web Development with Flask</a></h3>

<p><strong style="color: red;">Also a FOSSASIA Workshop</strong></p>

<p>Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. This means flask provides one with tools, libraries and technologies that allow you to build a web application. This workshop will introduce you to the basic syntax of flask as well as to build your own website!</p>

<h3 id="cybersecurity-with-python"><a href="https://youtu.be/P5ti4jgk7eQ">Cybersecurity with Python</a></h3>

<p><strong style="color: red;">Also a FOSSASIA Workshop</strong></p>

<p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes. Participants equip themselves with the basic skills of cybersecurity and tap on useful libraries that bring them through several hands-on activties such as port scanning.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-to-socket-programming-in-python"><a href="https://youtu.be/T248IPVosR4">Introduction to Socket Programming in Python</a></h3>

<p><strong style="color: red;">Also a FOSSASIA Workshop</strong></p>

<p>Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. This course will bring participants through the know-hows of socket programming in Python, as well as to set up a client-server architecture to run through several hands-on activities such as building a chat system and a RPG.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-to-sqlite3-in-python"><a href="">Introduction to SQLite3 in Python</a></h3>

<p><strong style="color: red;">Also a FOSSASIA Workshop</strong></p>

<p>Participants will learn about relational databases through SQLite, a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine which is the most widely deployed database in the world. Both single and multi-table (with normalization) scenarios will be covered. Participants will connect to SQLite using the Python sqlite3 standard library module to perform common operations. The course also brings participants through a hands-on activity to build a database.</p>

<h3 id="circuit-python-workshop"><a href="https://youtu.be/DsDeCd6VNj0">Circuit Python Workshop</a></h3>

<p>We organised a workshop about Circuit Programming with Python using the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express. Participants range from complete beginners to having some experience in Python. In the workshop, participants learned beyond basic python, and had fun playing around with the circuit playground they received, and expanded on their creativity to utilise what they can do with the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-to-python"><a href="https://youtu.be/Ms0BERdaIeI">Introduction to Python</a></h3>

<p>Python is a widely-popular and general-purpose language used by many developers. Learning a programming language has immeasurable advantages: Participants not only expose themselves to the art of <em>computational thinking</em>, the course will serve as a stepping stone for them to be equipped with the basics of Python so that they are able to embark on projects that can save the world (and automate their life ;)) Particularly, it is also the main language that will be used for ‚ÄòO‚Äô and ‚ÄòA‚Äô-Level Computing!</p>

<h3 id="introduction-to-mongodb-with-python"><a href="https://youtu.be/Gs3zYwtDXEw">Introduction to MongoDB with Python</a></h3>

<p>Participants will learn about MongoDB, a cross platform document-oriented NoSQL database system. They will connect to MongoDB using the PyMongo API to perform common operations. In fact, the course will also expose you to the commonalities of databases in our daily lives and bring you through a scenario of setting up a database for a Convenience Store.</p>
